/**
 * Order Line Mutations - Domain Types
 *
 * Type definitions for line-level mutation operations.
 * These types are shared between the Express tRPC router and
 * (future) TanStack Start Server Functions.
 *
 * NOTE: The actual mutation implementations live in the server package
 * (server/src/routes/orders/mutations/lineOps.ts) and use Prisma.
 * This file only contains shared type definitions.
